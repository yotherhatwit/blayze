## Project Overview
**Blayze** is designed to be an organizational app for overall wellness.

### Goal
Our long-term goal is to prevent acute or chronic illness by providing tertiary care and resources to avoid potential complications.

### Application Features
Blayze will be presented as a mobile application for ease and convenience. It will:

- Introduce users to a weekly survey
- Analyze the data entered
- Provide a routine to optimize health and free time
- Send reminders through notifications throughout the day

### Unique Value
While many similar applications exist, Blayze aims to serve as both a personal journal and a comprehensive hub for health monitoring.

Our commitment to consistency is what sets our app apart from competitors.
